# a-small-react-project

## Introduction
This project contains the code for a small React UI project. You most likely don't know how to use React to create frontend UI yet, but don't worry about that. The purpose of this project is for you to practice reading README file, in order to get started working with an existing code repository. 

## How to run the code
1. run `npm i` to install the dependencies
2. run `npm run dev` to start the development server and serve the web app
3. Open a browser and go to http://localhost:5173/

## Code structure
Currently the app is quite simple and only shows a gif, an h1 tag, and an h2 tag. You can find this in the file `/src/App.tsx`. The file `src/main.tsx` imports the `App` component and renders it using React. If you want to try to make some changes to the UI then I suggest that you start out with the `App.tsx` file. Try changing some of the text that is shown in the UI, and if you have the server running via `npm` then you should see those changes reflected immediately.
